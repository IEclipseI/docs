# Activating a promo code

Yandex regularly runs marketing campaigns with [promo codes](../concepts/promo-code.md) offered to users. If you received a promo code, activate it:
1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-billing }}), click ![image](../../_assets/main-menu.svg) and go to **Billing**.
1. Select an account on the **Accounts** page.
1. Click **Activate promo code** on the **Account info** page. The button only appears when a promo code is available.
1. Enter your promo code and click **Activate**.

All information about the added promo code will be available in the [management console]({{ link-console-billing }}), in the **Grants** section.
